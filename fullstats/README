------------------------FULLSTATS ATTRIBUTES GENERATOR------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This utility is used to create the full 266 features as defined by Moore(2004) 
for Traffic Classification. However we output only 249 features discarding 
confidential information from the flows, such as IP addresses in both 
direction, Port Information etc.

Two arff files are generated by the script which coincide with Moore 
investigation into Reduced feature set classification as well as the previous 
features defined.

	awmreduced.arff
	allclass.arff

Note a prefix is attached to all the files generated by the script.

--INSTALL

The following utilities need to be installed on your machine:
	-tcpdemux
	-tcptrace
	-tcpdump
	-tcpslice

Please note that we provide the original source files of these located under 
source-bin. The following command routine needs to be executed:
	./configure
	./make
	./make install
This will make each of the utility listed above accessible system wide.

You also need to set your path to the following directory as it contains the 
neccessary utility scripts which aid the attribute generator script.

	PATH=$PATH:/YOURPATH/fullstats/bin/scripts

--USAGE

1) flowCreator

Firstly you need to create a list which contains the dumpfiles. This is then
passed to the flowCreator to reassemble the flows and outputs a filelist and 
out directoy containing the reassembled flows.

	perl flowCreator dumplist

2) attributeGenerator

The filelist created by flowCreator is passed to the attributeGenerator to 
calculate the features. This outputs several files that contains a prefix.

	perl attributeGenerator filelist

3) arffCreator

The final stage is to create the arff file by appending all the relevant 
features from each file created by the attributeGenerator. This output two arff files: awmreduced and allclass.

	./arffCreator output_11........_

Note the arrfCreator requires you to provide the prefix of the files. It also uses two additional header files to append the weka headers to the results.
